            we have no money<br>
            we have no friends<br>
            we are in isolation<br>
            we don't know our location until jonas esc... I mean unless you see a gigantic covered weather-controlled place that probably looks like a bunker<br>
            we are surrounded by a literal barrier<br>
            we are tired from writing this code :p<br>
